# Machine-learning-algorithms

Machine learning algorithms created for the AI course in AUEB. These include Adaboost, Naive Bayes and ID3. Run the script through the main.py file. The purpose was to make sentiment classification ("good" or "bad") for the Keras IMDB dataset.

In the end, graphs are created to compare the results of the implementation to the sklearn library's corresponding algorithms.

Note: adaboost has a flaw somewhere, it is not yet 100% correct.
