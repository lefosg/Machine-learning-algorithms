# Machine-learning-algorithms

Machine learning algorithms created for the AI course in AUEB. These include Adaboost, Naive Bayes and ID3. Run the script through the main.py file.
<br>
In the end, graphs are created to compare the results of the implementation to the sklearn library's corresponding algorithms.
<br>
Note: adaboost has a flaw somewhere, it is not yet 100% correct.
